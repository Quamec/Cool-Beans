            </h2>
            <p>
              In the beginning, there was hot coffee.  Along with the coffee came the occassional spills, scalds, and the excitement of burning my mouth.  While each of these issues furthered the coffee's agenda of waking me up, I grew tired of being coffee's personal punching bag.  Like the static in the air before a thunder storm, the need for something new was forming in my mind.

              The wrong revolution.
            </h2>
            <p>
              That summer we saw some of the hottest days in decades.  Air-conditioners gave up the ghost while car interiors tried to murder drivers and passengers alike; gyms grew empty while temperature guages did all the heavy lifting.  It was like Satan himself accidently left the all the windows to Hell open.  And I found myself 110 degrees deep into a new dilemma.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coffee was a no-go in such a dystopian existence.  That was when I got hooked on the cold, rejuvinating, teeth rotting goodness of energy drinks.  By the end of summer, I was drinking two to three a day, always reaching for more.  But along with my refreshing new addiction came florescent urine, stomach aches and a need for increased teeth brushing.  I wanted cold and refreshing, but I needed something with less sugar, and less shame.

            </h2>
            <p>
              If morning people are like industrious early rising birds always competing to be the first to get the worm, I was the dodo: went to bed a few hundred years ago and still hasn't gotten up.  One particularly depraved morning after switching back to coffee, I found myself in the kitchen, too groggy to clean out the coffee pot.  So, I took yesterday's coffee and poured it over ice to numb the shame.
            </p>
            <p>
              To my disappointment in myself, I found myself reaching for another glass.  And that's when it hit me.  If I could improve the taste of cold, dark sludge, then I might have the product on which I could build a career, and fund my questionable habits!

              How to make people enjoy drinking oil.
            </h2>
            <p>
              It took over six months for me to finally succeed in crafting a oil-esque substance that not only tasted desirable, but also required no preparation from would be sloths in need of a pick-me-up.  It took another three months to convince enough people to try it.  Finally, a year from its inception, I was crafting, and selling, a product with as cold and black a heart as my mother.  Since then, I've invented two new flavors, all three with less than half the sugar of an energy drink, and twice the kick.
            </p>
            <p>
              I made my first billion at the age that has yet to occur.  But when it happens, I'll update here.
